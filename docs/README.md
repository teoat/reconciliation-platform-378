# Documentation Index

Curated reference for the `docs/` directory after the root-level documentation cleanup.

## Core References
- `../README.md` – Primary landing page with quick start, configuration, and contribution flow. Share this alongside the refreshed `../DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` with the broader team for review/feedback.
- `../DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` – Single source for dev/production/Kubernetes rollout steps.
- `project-history.md` – Timeline of milestones and links to supporting materials.

## Operational Playbooks
- `../DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` – Primary reference for environments, go-live checkpoints, and operations cadence.
- `INCIDENT_RESPONSE_RUNBOOKS.md`, `SUPPORT_MAINTENANCE_GUIDE.md`, `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` – Stay; remain the canonical operational procedures.

## Architecture & Engineering
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `INFRASTRUCTURE.md`, `SSOT_GUIDANCE.md` – Platform design, infrastructure topology, and configuration governance.
- `API_DOCUMENTATION.md` – Consolidated REST/WebSocket reference.

## Testing & Readiness
- `UAT_PLAN.md`, `UAT_SUMMARY.md`, `USER_TRAINING_GUIDE.md` – User acceptance, training workstreams.

## Next Cleanup Actions
- Consolidate deployment runbooks (`DEPLOYMENT_OPERATIONS_GUIDE.md`, `PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md`, etc.) into the updated `../DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`.
- Deduplicate API docs (`API_DOCUMENTATION.md` vs `API.md`).
- Decide whether legacy go-live summaries need to become appendices in `project-history.md` or can be removed.
- Confirm all cross-links point to existing files post-cleanup.
