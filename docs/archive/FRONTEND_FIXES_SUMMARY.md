# üîß Frontend Critical Fixes - Summary

**Status**: In Progress  
**Date**: January 2025

---

## ‚úÖ Completed Fixes

1. **Added missing `configureStore` import** - Fixed line 996 error
2. **Fixed type imports** - Added BackendUser, BackendProject, etc.
3. **Updated reducer type signatures** - Changed from generic types to backend types
4. **Commented out non-existent API methods** - startReconciliation, createManualMatch
5. **Created comprehensive error analysis** - FRONTEND_ERROR_ANALYSIS.md

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Remaining Issues

### Critical Syntax Errors
The file still has duplicate/stray code blocks that need manual cleanup:

**Lines 532-549**: Duplicate reducer definitions that need to be removed
**Lines 534-547**: More duplicate code

These were introduced during automated editing and need manual review.

## üéØ Next Steps

### Manual Cleanup Required:
1. Read `frontend/src/store/index.ts` lines 529-549
2. Identify and remove duplicate reducer definitions
3. Ensure the reconciliationSlice closes properly with `})`
4. Run `npm run build` to verify compilation
5. Run linter to check remaining errors

### Complete the remaining fixes:
1. Fix `fetchReconciliationRecords` to accept projectId parameter
2. Update `response.data?.project` to `response.data`
3. Remove unused type imports
