# ✅ Docker Daemon Issue - RESOLVED

**Date:** January 2025  
**Issue:** Docker daemon not detected  
**Resolution:** Context switched to desktop-linux  
**Status:** SUCCESS

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

**The Problem:**
```bash
Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock
```

**The Issue:**
- Docker was using `default` context pointing to `/var/run/docker.sock`
- This path doesn't exist on macOS
- Docker Desktop runs at `/Users/Arief/.docker/run/docker.sock`

**The Solution:**
```bash
docker context use desktop-linux
```
