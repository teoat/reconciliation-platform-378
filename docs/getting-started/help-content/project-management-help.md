# Project Management Help

## Overview

Project management allows you to organize your reconciliation work into separate projects. Each project can have its own data sources, matching rules, and reconciliation results.

## Getting Started

1. **Create a New Project**
   - Click the "New Project" button
   - Enter project name and description
   - Select a project template (if available)
   - Click "Create"

2. **Access Your Projects**
   - View all projects in the Projects dashboard
   - Use filters to find specific projects
   - Sort by name, date, or status

3. **Project Settings**
   - Configure project-specific settings
   - Set up data sources
   - Define matching rules
   - Configure export formats

## Common Tasks

- **Creating Projects**: Start new reconciliation projects with custom configurations
- **Organizing Projects**: Use folders and tags to organize multiple projects
- **Sharing Projects**: Collaborate with team members on shared projects
- **Archiving Projects**: Archive completed projects to keep your workspace clean
