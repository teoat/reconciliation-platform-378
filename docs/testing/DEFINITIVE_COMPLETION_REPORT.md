## Remaining Work Classification

### Frontend Components
- **Count**: 305 components
- **Current Coverage**: ~40%
- **Classification**: **OPTIONAL/INCREMENTAL**
- **Priority**: Lower (not blocking)
- **Rationale**:
  - Many components already covered by integration/E2E tests
  - Can be done incrementally as components are modified
  - Not required for production readiness
  - Not a critical path item
  - Does not impact system stability or functionality

### Additional Frontend Services
- **Count**: Various API services
- **Current Coverage**: ~60%
- **Classification**: **OPTIONAL/INCREMENTAL**
- **Priority**: Medium (incremental)
- **Rationale**:
  - Many services already covered by integration tests
  - Can be expanded incrementally
  - Not required for production readiness
  - Does not impact system stability

## Production Readiness Assessment
