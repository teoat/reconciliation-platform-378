Run a comprehensive and deep diagnosis of the entire codebase. Execute the following workflow:

PHASE 1: RUN ALL DIAGNOSTICS
1. Execute comprehensive diagnostic script: ./scripts/comprehensive-diagnostic.sh
2. Run SSOT validation: ./scripts/validate-ssot.sh
3. Run import validation: ./scripts/validate-imports.sh
4. Check backend compilation: cargo check --verbose (in backend/)
5. Check frontend type checking: npx tsc --noEmit (in frontend/)
6. Run linter checks: npm run lint and cargo clippy
7. Run security audits: npm audit and cargo audit
8. Run test coverage: ./scripts/test-coverage-audit-enhanced.sh
9. Run bundle analysis: ./scripts/analyze-bundle-size.sh
10. Use MCP diagnostic tools: run_diagnostic with scope='full'

PHASE 2: INVESTIGATE ALL FINDINGS
For each finding discovered:
- Perform root cause analysis (trace to source, identify contributing factors)
- Detect patterns (check if part of systemic issue, search for similar problems)
- Assess impact (severity: Critical/High/Medium/Low, business/user impact, fix complexity)
- Analyze dependencies (how issues relate, blocking relationships, fix order)

PHASE 3: COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS
Generate complete analysis covering:
1. Executive Summary: Overall health score, critical issues count, top recommendations
2. Detailed Findings: For each category (Backend, Frontend, Security, Code Quality, Testing, Documentation):
   - Current state (scores, metrics, status)
   - Complete issues list with severity
   - Root cause analysis
   - Impact assessment (business, technical, user)
   - Pattern detection (recurring issues, systemic problems)
   - Dependency mapping
3. Deep Investigation: For each critical/high issue:
   - Code examples showing the problem
   - Related issues found
   - Historical context (when/why introduced)
   - Contributing factors
4. Recommendations:
   - Immediate actions (critical fixes)
   - Short-term (1-2 weeks)
   - Medium-term (1-3 months)
   - Long-term (3-6 months)
   - Best practices to adopt/avoid
5. Action Plan: Prioritized task list with effort estimates, dependencies, implementation order, risk assessment
6. Metrics & Trends: Comparison with previous diagnostics, trend analysis, benchmarks

PHASE 4: CODE REVIEW
- Architecture review (SSOT compliance, code organization, module boundaries)
- Pattern review (anti-patterns, best practice violations, error handling)
- Security review (OWASP Top 10, auth patterns, input validation)
- Performance review (query optimization, API performance, bundle size)

PHASE 5: GENERATE REPORT
Create comprehensive markdown report at: docs/analysis/COMPREHENSIVE_DIAGNOSTIC_REPORT_[TIMESTAMP].md

Report must include:
- Executive summary with overall health score
- Complete findings catalog (all issues with severity, location, description, root cause, impact, recommendations)
- Deep investigation results (root cause analysis, patterns, related issues, historical context)
- Detailed recommendations (immediate, short-term, medium-term, long-term)
- Prioritized action plan (tasks with priority, effort, dependencies, risk)
- Metrics and trends
- Code review findings
- Conclusion with next steps

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- All diagnostic scores and metrics
- Complete list of findings with code examples
- Root cause analysis for each issue
- Impact assessment for each finding
- Detailed, actionable recommendations
- Prioritized action plan with timeline
- Risk assessment
- Both markdown report and JSON summary

VALIDATION:
- Verify all findings are real (not false positives)
- Confirm severity classifications are accurate
- Check for duplicate findings
- Ensure recommendations are actionable
- Validate action plan is feasible
- Cross-reference with known issues

Execute this workflow completely and provide the comprehensive diagnostic report with all findings, investigations, analysis, and recommendations.
