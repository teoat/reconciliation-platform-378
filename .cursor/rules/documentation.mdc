- **Documentation Structure:**
  - All documentation in `docs/` directory (SSOT location)
  - One document per topic (no duplicates)
  - Organize by category: `api/`, `architecture/`, `deployment/`, `features/`, `operations/`
  - Archive outdated docs to `docs/archive/`

- **Document Types (Aggressively Simplified):**
  - **GUIDE**: Permanent reference documentation only - `[TOPIC]_GUIDE.md` or `[topic]-guide.md`
  - **STATUS**: Single master status file - `docs/project-management/PROJECT_STATUS.md` (ONE file only)
  - **ARCHIVE**: Everything else - move to `docs/archive/[category]/` immediately
  - **FORBIDDEN**: COMPLETE, SUMMARY, REPORT, PROPOSAL, PROGRESS, CHECKLIST, TODO, DIAGNOSTIC (archive immediately)
  - **EXCEPTION**: Only keep essential guides (API, Deployment, Architecture, Getting Started)

- **File Naming:**
  - Guides: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE.md` for major guides: `API_REFERENCE.md`, `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
  - Plans/Status: `[FEATURE]_PLAN.md`, `[FEATURE]_STATUS.md`
  - Feature docs: `kebab-case.md` for feature-specific: `password-manager-guide.md`
  - Use descriptive names that indicate content

- **Document Structure:**

  ```markdown
  # Title
  
  **Last Updated**: Month Year  
  **Status**: [Active | Deprecated]
  
  ## Overview
  Brief description (1-2 sentences)
  
  ## Table of Contents (if > 3 sections)
  
  ## Main Content
  Clear sections with headers
  
  ## Related Documentation
  - [Link to related doc](./path/to/doc.md)
  ```

- **Content Guidelines:**
  - Start with overview/quick start
  - Include practical examples
  - Cross-reference related docs
  - Keep it concise - remove redundancy
  - Update "Last Updated" when modifying

- **Aggressive Consolidation Rules (MANDATORY):**
  - **BEFORE creating new doc**: Check if topic exists, if yes → update existing, don't create new
  - **Status/Completion/Summary files**: Archive immediately (keep only PROJECT_STATUS.md)
  - **Diagnostic reports**: Archive after 7 days (keep only comprehensive audits if needed)
  - **Multiple similar files**: Merge into ONE comprehensive guide, archive rest
  - **Plans/Proposals**: Convert to tasks in PROJECT_STATUS.md, then archive
  - **Checklists**: Integrate into guides or PROJECT_STATUS.md, then archive
  - **Maximum active docs**: ~20-30 essential guides only

- **Documentation Categories:**
  - `docs/api/` - API references and guides
  - `docs/architecture/` - System architecture and design
  - `docs/deployment/` - Deployment guides and procedures
  - `docs/development/` - Development tools and setup
  - `docs/features/` - Feature-specific documentation
  - `docs/operations/` - Operations and troubleshooting
  - `docs/getting-started/` - Quick start and onboarding

- **When to Archive (Aggressive):**
  - **Status/completion/summary reports** → Archive immediately (keep only PROJECT_STATUS.md)
  - **Diagnostic reports** → Archive after 7 days (unless comprehensive audit)
  - **Multiple files covering same topic** → Merge into one guide, archive rest immediately
  - **Plans/Proposals** → Convert to tasks in PROJECT_STATUS.md, archive original
  - **Checklists** → Integrate into guides, archive standalone checklists
  - **Progress reports** → Archive immediately (track in PROJECT_STATUS.md)
  - **Outdated guides** → Archive or update (no outdated docs in active folders)

- **Code Examples in Docs:**

  ```markdown
  ```bash
  # Clear command examples
  docker-compose up -d
  ```
  
  ```typescript
  // Include context and comments
  const example = useExample();
  ```
  ```

- **Cross-References:**
  - Use relative paths: `[Deployment Guide](./deployment/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)`
  - Update `docs/README.md` when adding new docs
  - Link related sections within same doc

- **Aggressive Maintenance (MANDATORY):**
  - **Weekly**: Archive any new status/completion/summary reports
  - **Monthly**: Review and archive diagnostic reports older than 7 days
  - **Quarterly**: Audit all docs, archive anything not essential guide
  - **Always**: Update "Last Updated" dates when modifying
  - **Always**: Remove broken links immediately
  - **Target**: Maximum 20-30 active documentation files total

- **Aggressive Document Lifecycle (MANDATORY):**
  - **PLAN/PROPOSAL** → Convert to tasks in PROJECT_STATUS.md → Archive immediately
  - **STATUS/COMPLETE/SUMMARY** → Archive immediately (keep only PROJECT_STATUS.md)
  - **REPORT/DIAGNOSTIC** → Archive after 7 days (unless comprehensive audit)
  - **CHECKLIST** → Integrate into guides → Archive standalone checklists
  - **GUIDE** → Only permanent reference docs stay active

- **Mandatory Consolidation Rules:**
  - **ALL status files** → Consolidate into `docs/project-management/PROJECT_STATUS.md`, archive rest
  - **ALL completion/summary files** → Archive immediately
  - **ALL diagnostic reports** → Archive after 7 days (unless comprehensive audit)
  - **ALL plans/proposals** → Convert to tasks in PROJECT_STATUS.md, archive originals
  - **ALL checklists** → Integrate into guides, archive standalone
  - **Maximum active docs**: 20-30 essential guides + PROJECT_STATUS.md only

- **Archive Organization (MANDATORY):**
  - **Structure**: `docs/archive/[category]/[YYYY-MM]/` - organize by category and month
  - **Categories**: `completion-reports/`, `diagnostics/`, `plans/`, `reports/`, `status/`, `checklists/`
  - **Naming**: Keep original filename, add archive date prefix if needed
  - **Cleanup**: Delete archived files older than 1 year (unless historical significance)

- **Active Documentation Limits:**
  - **Maximum**: 20-30 essential guide files total
  - **Allowed**: API guides, Deployment guides, Architecture guides, Getting Started guides
  - **Forbidden**: Status, completion, summary, diagnostic, plan, proposal, checklist files in active folders
  - **Exception**: PROJECT_STATUS.md (single master status file only)
