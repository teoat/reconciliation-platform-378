## 🚧 IN PROGRESS: Page Refactoring

### Phase 1: Type Definitions ✅ **COMPLETE**

**Status**: ✅ **100% COMPLETE**

**Completed**:
- ✅ Created `types/ingestion/index.ts` with all ingestion types (205+ lines)
- ✅ Created `types/reconciliation/index.ts` with all reconciliation types (150+ lines)
- ✅ Added common types (SortConfig, FilterConfig, PaginationConfig)
- ✅ Created directory structure (components/, hooks/, utils/)

**Remaining**:
- [x] Update `pages/IngestionPage.tsx` to import from types (remove duplicates) ✅ **COMPLETE**
- [x] Update `pages/ReconciliationPage.tsx` to import from types (remove duplicates) ✅ **COMPLETE**

**Result**: Reduced file sizes by 350 lines (208 from IngestionPage, 142 from ReconciliationPage)

---

### Phase 2-6: Remaining Refactoring ⏳ **PENDING**

**Status**: 🚧 **15% COMPLETE** (Foundation ready)

**Remaining Work**:
1. ⏳ **Phase 2**: Extract utility functions (2-3 hours)
2. ⏳ **Phase 3**: Extract components - 10 components (12-16 hours)
3. ⏳ **Phase 4**: Extract hooks - 7 hooks (8-10 hours)
4. ⏳ **Phase 5**: Refactor main pages to ~500 lines each (4-6 hours)
5. ⏳ **Phase 6**: Testing & verification (2-3 hours)

**Total Remaining**: 28-41 hours

**See**: `REFACTORING_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` for detailed breakdown

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps

### Priority 1: Complete Type Integration (30 min)
1. Update `pages/IngestionPage.tsx`:
   - Remove duplicate type definitions (lines 53-278)
   - Add: `import { ... } from '../types/ingestion'`
   - Verify no type errors

2. Update `pages/ReconciliationPage.tsx`:
   - Remove duplicate type definitions (lines 90-246)
   - Add: `import { ... } from '../types/reconciliation'`
   - Verify no type errors

### Priority 2: Extract First Component (1-2 hours)
- Choose simplest component (e.g., `DataQualityPanel.tsx`)
- Extract from IngestionPage
- Create component file
- Update IngestionPage to use it
- Verify functionality

### Priority 3: Continue Systematic Extraction
- Follow the plan in `REFACTORING_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md`
- Extract one component/hook at a time
- Test after each extraction
- Commit frequently
