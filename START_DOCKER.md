# 🐳 How to Start Docker

## Docker Status

Docker Desktop is installed but not currently running.

## 🚀 Start Docker

### Option 1: Manual Start
1. Open Docker Desktop from your Applications folder
2. Wait for the whale icon to appear in the menu bar (top right on Mac)
3. Wait for "Docker Desktop is running" message
4. Run: `docker ps` to verify

### Option 2: Command Line (Mac)
```bash
open -a Docker
```

### Option 3: PowerShell (Windows)
```powershell
Start-Process "C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\Docker Desktop.exe"
```

## ✅ Verify Docker is Running

```bash
docker ps
```

You should see a list of running containers (or empty if none).

## 🎯 After Docker Starts

Once Docker is running, you can deploy:

```bash
bash deploy.sh
```

Or manually:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## ⏱️ Wait Time

Docker Desktop can take 30-60 seconds to fully start. Be patient!
