# Increase stack size to prevent stack overflow with deep middleware chains
# 16MB stack size (16777216 bytes) - macOS/Linux compatible

[env]
# Set minimum stack size for Rust threads
RUST_MIN_STACK = "167772216"  # 16MB in bytes

# Note: On macOS, you may also need to increase the stack size via linker flags:
# rustflags = ["-C", "link-args=-Wl,-stack_size,10000000"]
# However, RUST_MIN_STACK is more portable across platforms.
