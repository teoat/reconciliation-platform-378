## üåÄ PHASE 0: BUSINESS & USER VALUE DEFINITION (THE "NORTH STAR")

### Business Value Proposition (BVP)
**Primary BVP**: "Enable enterprise finance teams to reconcile multi-source financial data with 99.9% accuracy in 80% less time, reducing manual errors and compliance risk through AI-powered automated matching."

### User Personas
1. **Persona 1: "The Financial Analyst"** (Primary)

   - Success: Complete reconciliation in <2 hours with >99% accuracy

2. **Persona 2: "The Data Engineer"** (Secondary)
   - Needs: Reliable pipelines, automated processing, API access
   - Success: Process 10M+ records reliably with <1% failure rate

3. **Persona 3: "The Compliance Officer"** (Tertiary)
   - Needs: Audit trails, data integrity, regulatory compliance
   - Success: Complete audit trail for all actions; GDPR compliance

### Core User Journeys (CUJ)
- **CUJ 1**: Standard Reconciliation Flow (Primary - 6 steps)
- **CUJ 2**: Bulk Reconciliation via API (Secondary)
- **CUJ 3**: Audit & Compliance Review (Tertiary)

**‚úÖ PHASE 0 STATUS**: Complete - North Star defined and validated

## üåÄ PHASE 1: CODEBASE PRUNING & SSOT (TIER 3 VERIFIED)

### Files Deleted (High Confidence)
‚úÖ `backend/src/handlers_old.rs` - 1857 lines, orphaned  
‚úÖ `backend/src/main_graceful_shutdown.rs` - Alternative implementation, not used  
‚úÖ `backend/src/services/cache_old.rs` - Replaced by modular cache  
‚úÖ `backend/src/middleware/security_old.rs` - Replaced by security/mod.rs

### Files Requiring Review
- `backend/src/handlers_modules_backup/` - Backup directory, verify if needed for recovery
- `backend/src/schema.rs` (root) - Contains subscriptions table, but subscriptions not used yet

### Meta Features Identified for Offloading
- Gamification module (`gamification/ReconciliationStreakBadge.tsx`)
- Frenly AI components (`frenly/` directory)
- Advanced Visualization (`AdvancedVisualization.tsx`)
- Collaborative features (CollaborationPanel, CollaborativeFeatures)
- Mobile optimization service
- Internationalization service

**‚úÖ PHASE 1 STATUS**: In Progress - Core orphans deleted, backup directory needs archiving

---

## üåÄ PHASE 2: LOGICAL INTEGRITY & SIMPLIFICATION (TIER 3 VERIFIED)

### Logic Gaps Identified
1. **Missing Transaction Boundaries**
   - Reconciliation job creation (multi-step: job + verification)
   - Match approval (updates match + records status)
   - **Risk**: Partial data corruption on failure

2. **God Functions to Refactor**
   - `backend/src/services/project.rs` (1269 lines) ‚Üí Split into:
     - `ProjectCRUDService`
     - `ProjectPermissionService`
     - `ProjectAggregationService`
   - `backend/src/services/reconciliation.rs` (large) ‚Üí Split by responsibility
   - `backend/src/main.rs` (721 lines) ‚Üí Extract routing and bootstrap

**‚úÖ PHASE 2 STATUS**: Pending - Transactions and refactoring needed

---

## üåÄ PHASE 3: HOLISTIC OPTIMIZATION (TIER 3 VERIFIED)

### Algorithmic Optimizations
1. **Reconciliation Matching**: O(n¬≤) ‚Üí O(n log n)
   - Current: Pairwise comparison
   - Proposed: Indexed matching (hash-based for exact, then fuzzy)
   - Trade-off: +O(n) memory for 100x+ speed improvement

2. **Database Queries**: ‚úÖ N+1 queries already fixed (per TODO)

### Security Audit Required
- Run `cargo audit` for Rust dependencies
- Run `npm audit` for frontend dependencies
- ‚úÖ JWT secret fallback removed (P0-SEC-001 complete)
- ‚úÖ GDPR endpoints wired (P0-SEC-003 complete)

### Cost Optimization
- Review K8s HPA scaling (currently 3-10 replicas)
- Database connection pool sizing
- Redis cache memory allocation

**‚úÖ PHASE 3 STATUS**: Pending - Algorithm optimization and security audit needed

---

## üåÄ PHASE 4: DATA & STATE ARCHITECTURE AUDIT (TIER 3 VERIFIED)

### Schema Analysis
**‚úÖ Strengths**:
- Proper foreign keys and relationships
- UUIDs for primary keys
- JSONB for flexible metadata
- Timestamps on all tables

**‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Identified**:
1. **Missing Composite Indexes** (verify if applied)
   - `reconciliation_records(project_id, status)`
   - `reconciliation_matches(confidence_score)` 
   - `data_sources(project_id, status)`

2. **Transaction Boundaries Missing**
   - Job creation: job + data source verification
   - Match approval: match status + record status updates

3. **Data Integrity**
   - `reconciliation_matches.confidence_score` nullable - should not be null for confirmed matches

**‚úÖ PHASE 4 STATUS**: Pending - Index verification and transactions needed

---

## üåÄ PHASE 5: USER JOURNEY & UX OPTIMIZATION

### Chatty API Issues
**CUJ 1, Step 4** (Review Results):
- Current: 4+ separate API calls (matches, scores, details, stats)
- Proposed BFF: `GET /api/projects/:id/reconciliation/view` (single call)

**CUJ 1, Step 5** (Resolve Conflicts):
- Current: Multiple `POST /api/reconciliation/resolve` calls
- Proposed: `POST /api/reconciliation/batch-resolve`

### Payload Optimization
- List endpoints return minimal fields (id, summary, status)
- Detail endpoints return full objects
- Field selection: `?fields=id,name,status`

**New BFF Endpoints Needed**:
1. `GET /api/projects/:id/reconciliation/view` - Aggregated view
2. `POST /api/reconciliation/batch-resolve` - Batch conflict resolution
3. `GET /api/projects/:id/upload-status` - Upload progress endpoint

**‚úÖ PHASE 5 STATUS**: Pending - BFF endpoints and payload optimization needed

---

## üåÄ PHASE 6: HYPER-OPTIMIZED BUILD & DEPLOYMENT

### Docker Optimization
- Multi-stage Dockerfile with Alpine/distroless
- Non-root user
- Optimal COPY layer caching
- .dockerignore optimization

### Deployment Configs
- Production-ready docker-compose.yml
- Kubernetes deployment.yaml and service.yaml
- Health checks (liveness/readiness)
- Resource limits (CPU/memory)
- Restart policies

### CI/CD
- Build/dependency caching
- GitHub Actions workflow

**‚è≥ PHASE 6 STATUS**: Pending

---

## üåÄ PHASE 7: VALIDATION & BENCHMARKING

### Test Suite Needed
- Unit tests for refactored code (Phases 2-5)
- Journey tests for CUJs (Phase 0)
- Load testing script (k6 or similar)

### Benchmark Targets
- API response time: <200ms P95
- Reconciliation processing: <2 hours for 1M records
- Match accuracy: 99.9%

**‚è≥ PHASE 7 STATUS**: Pending

---

## üåÄ PHASE 8: RECURSIVE CONFLICT REPORT (THE "MACRO" LOOP)

### Conflicts to Resolve
1. **Tech vs. Business**: Algorithm optimization (memory trade-off) vs. performance requirements
2. **Tech vs. User**: BFF endpoints vs. existing API structure
3. **Decoupling**: Meta features vs. core functionality

**Action**: Review all Phase 1-7 recommendations against North Star (Phase 0)

**‚è≥ PHASE 8 STATUS**: Pending

---
