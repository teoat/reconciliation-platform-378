# This script is intended to be a curated collection of commands to refactor
# duplicated code found by jscpd. Each command should be surgical and verifiable.

echo "Starting automated refactoring of duplicated code..."

# Example of a targeted refactoring command (add more as needed):
# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# Refactor duplicated test setup in reconciliation tests.
# This would involve creating a shared test utility and replacing the
# duplicated code with a call to that utility.
#
# sed -i '' -e 's/duplication_pattern/refactored_code/g' frontend/src/utils/reconciliation/__tests__/*.test.ts

echo "Automated refactoring script is ready to be populated with specific commands."

# For now, this script is a placeholder. It will be populated with commands
# after a more detailed analysis of the duplication report.

echo "Refactoring script created. Next step is to analyze the duplication report."
