# 🚀 DEPLOYMENT IN PROGRESS

**Started:** January 2025  
**Status:** Building Docker Images

---

## Current Step: Building Images

The deployment process is currently:

1. ✅ **Docker Daemon Started**
2. ✅ **Environment Configured**  
3. 🔄 **Building Docker Images** ← **YOU ARE HERE**
4. ⏳ Starting Services
5. ⏳ Health Checks
6. ⏳ Verification

---

## What's Happening

### Backend Build (Rust)
- Compiling Rust dependencies (~45 packages)
- Building backend binary with optimizations
- Creating multi-stage Docker image
- **Estimated time:** 5-10 minutes

### Frontend Build (React)
- Installing Node.js dependencies (26 packages)
- Building React application with Vite
- Optimizing and bundling assets
- **Estimated time:** 3-5 minutes

---

## Monitor Progress

Run these commands to monitor:

```bash
# View build progress
docker compose logs -f

# Check Docker processes
docker ps

# View disk usage
docker system df
```

---

## Expected Results

After build completes, you should have:

- ✅ Backend image: ~80MB
- ✅ Frontend image: ~70MB  
- ✅ All 6 services running
- ✅ Health checks passing
- ✅ Platform accessible at http://localhost:1000

---

## Next Steps After Build

Once the build completes, the script will:

1. Start all services (postgres, redis, backend, frontend, prometheus, grafana)
2. Run health checks
3. Verify all endpoints
4. Display access URLs

**Total deployment time:** ~15-20 minutes
