This directory is not the canonical source for MCP configuration.

Canonical MCP configuration lives at the repository root in .cursor/mcp.json.

If a tool requires an MCP config here, create a symlink to ../../.cursor/mcp.json, or copy it during setup. Do not maintain divergent configuration in this directory.
