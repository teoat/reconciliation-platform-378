# Comprehensive Test Plan & Implementation Status

## ‚úÖ Completed Fixes

### 1. Authentication System
- ‚úÖ Login navigation fixed - redirects to dashboard after success
- ‚úÖ Registration form added with strict password validation
- ‚úÖ Protected routes implemented - redirects authenticated users
- ‚úÖ Password validation fixed - login accepts any format, registration requires strict format

### 2. Frontend Infrastructure
- ‚úÖ React chunk loading order fixed (useSyncExternalStore error resolved)
- ‚úÖ Dashboard navigation buttons fixed - uses React Router instead of window.location
- ‚úÖ Error boundaries and loading states implemented

## üîÑ In Progress / To Test

### 3. Dashboard Functionality
- [ ] Test system status health check display
- [ ] Test projects list loading
- [ ] Test project creation flow
- [ ] Test project navigation (clicking on projects)

### 4. Project Management
- [ ] Create project route (`/projects/new`) - **NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION**
- [ ] Project detail view
- [ ] Project update/delete functionality
- [ ] Project list with pagination

### 5. File Upload & Processing
- [ ] File upload route (`/upload`) - **NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION**
- [ ] File upload form with project selection
- [ ] File processing status tracking
- [ ] Data source management

### 6. Reconciliation Features
- [ ] Quick reconciliation wizard (`/quick-reconciliation`) - **EXISTS**
- [ ] Reconciliation page (`/projects/:projectId/reconciliation`) - **EXISTS**
- [ ] Reconciliation job creation
- [ ] Match resolution interface
- [ ] Batch operations

### 7. Analytics Dashboard
- [ ] Analytics route (`/analytics`) - **EXISTS**
- [ ] Dashboard metrics loading
- [ ] Charts and visualizations
- [ ] Time range filtering

### 8. User Management
- [ ] Users list route (`/users`) - **EXISTS**
- [ ] User CRUD operations
- [ ] Role management
- [ ] User activity tracking

### 9. API Integration
- [ ] API status route (`/api-status`) - **EXISTS**
- [ ] API tester route (`/api-tester`) - **EXISTS**
- [ ] API documentation route (`/api-docs`) - **EXISTS**
- [ ] Backend health check integration

## üìã Missing Routes to Implement

### High Priority
1. **Create Project Page** (`/projects/new`)
   - Form for creating new projects
   - Name, description, settings
   - Redirect to project detail after creation

2. **File Upload Page** (`/upload`)
   - File selection interface
   - Project selection dropdown
   - Upload progress tracking
   - File list after upload

### Medium Priority
3. **Project Detail Page** (`/projects/:id`)
   - Project information display
   - Data sources list
   - Reconciliation jobs list
   - Quick actions (edit, delete, start reconciliation)

4. **Project Edit Page** (`/projects/:id/edit`)
   - Edit project form
   - Update project settings

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Authentication Flow
- [x] User can register with valid credentials
- [x] User can login with registered credentials
- [x] User is redirected to dashboard after login/registration
- [x] Protected routes redirect to login if not authenticated
- [x] Authenticated users are redirected from login to dashboard

### Dashboard
- [ ] Dashboard loads without errors
- [ ] System status displays correctly
- [ ] Projects list loads from API
- [ ] Empty state displays when no projects exist
- [ ] Quick action buttons navigate correctly

### Project Management
- [ ] Can create a new project
- [ ] Can view project details
- [ ] Can update project information
- [ ] Can delete a project
- [ ] Project list pagination works

### File Operations
- [ ] Can upload a file
- [ ] Upload progress is displayed
- [ ] File appears in data sources list
- [ ] Can process uploaded file
- [ ] Can delete data source

### Reconciliation
- [ ] Can start a reconciliation job
- [ ] Job status is tracked
- [ ] Matches are displayed
- [ ] Can resolve matches (approve/reject)
- [ ] Batch operations work

### Error Handling
- [ ] Network errors are handled gracefully
- [ ] Validation errors display correctly
- [ ] 401 errors redirect to login
- [ ] 404 errors show appropriate message
- [ ] Error boundaries catch React errors

## üîß Technical Improvements Needed

### 1. Route Implementation
- Create Project Creation component
- Create File Upload component
- Create Project Detail component

### 2. Error Handling
- Global error handler for API failures
- Toast notifications for success/error messages
- Loading states for all async operations

### 3. Data Validation
- Form validation for all inputs
- API response validation
- Type safety improvements

### 4. Performance
- Implement code splitting for large components
- Add lazy loading for routes
- Optimize API calls with caching

## üìä Test Results

### Current Status
- **Backend**: ‚úÖ Running and healthy
- **Frontend**: ‚úÖ Built and running
- **Authentication**: ‚úÖ Working
- **Navigation**: ‚úÖ Fixed
- **API Integration**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs testing

### Known Issues
1. Socket.io WebSocket 404s (non-critical)
2. Missing `/projects/new` route
3. Missing `/upload` route
4. Project detail view needs implementation

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Test authentication and dashboard
2. **Short-term**: Implement missing routes
3. **Medium-term**: Complete CRUD operations testing
4. **Long-term**: Performance optimization and feature completion
