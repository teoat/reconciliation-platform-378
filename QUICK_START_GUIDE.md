# ‚ö° QUICK START GUIDE
## Get Your Platform Running in 5 Steps

## üöÄ **STEP-BY-STEP QUICK START**

### **Step 1: Verify Docker is Running**
```bash
docker info
```

### **Step 2: Start All Services**
```bash
cd /Users/Arief/Desktop/378
docker compose up -d
```

This will start:
- PostgreSQL database
- Redis cache
- Backend API (may have issues)
- Frontend (needs Node.js)
- Monitoring services

### **Step 3: Check Status**
```bash
docker compose ps
```

You should see all services starting.

### **Step 4: View Logs**
```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

### **Step 5: Test Services**
```bash
# Database
docker compose exec postgres psql -U reconciliation_user -d reconciliation_app -c "SELECT version();"

# Redis
docker compose exec redis redis-cli ping

# Backend health (if started)
curl http://localhost:2000/health
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **EXPECTED ISSUES & SOLUTIONS**

### **Backend Won't Start?**
This is expected due to compilation errors. You'll see:
- Backend container keeps restarting
- Logs show compilation errors

**Solutions**:
1. Fix backend code locally
2. Build a working version
3. Then deploy

### **Frontend Won't Start?**
Need Node.js installed:
```bash
# On macOS with Homebrew
brew install node@18

# Then rebuild
docker compose up frontend --build
```

---

## üìã **WHAT TO DO NEXT**

### **Option 1: Focus on Working Services**
Use what's working now:

```bash
# Test database
docker compose exec postgres psql -U reconciliation_user -d reconciliation_app

# Test Redis
docker compose exec redis redis-cli

# Explore the database schema
docker compose exec postgres psql -U reconciliation_user -d reconciliation_app -c "\dt"
```

### **Option 2: Fix Backend and Retry**
Work on the backend compilation errors, then retry deployment.

### **Option 3: Run Services Locally**
Skip Docker, run locally:
- Database: Already running in Docker
- Backend: `cd backend && cargo run` (after fixing errors)
- Frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev` (after installing Node.js)

---

## üéØ **RECOMMENDATION**

Since you have the database and Redis running successfully:

1. **Keep using them** - they're working perfectly
2. **Work on backend code** - fix the compilation errors
3. **Install Node.js** - for frontend development
4. **Test locally** - connect backend to Docker database

This approach will get you up and running faster than fixing all Docker issues!

**Next Command to Try**:
```bash
docker compose up -d
docker compose ps
docker compose logs -f
```
