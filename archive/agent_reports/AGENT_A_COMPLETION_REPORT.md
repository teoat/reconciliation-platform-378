**Status**: âœ… **COMPLETE**

## âœ… Work Completed

### Issue Found
- Found 3 instances of incorrect `req.extensions()` calls
- These should be `http_req.extensions()` since the HttpRequest parameter is named `http_req`
- Error was caused by calling `extensions()` on the wrong object (Json instead of HttpRequest)

### Fix Applied
- Changed all `req.extensions()` to `http_req.extensions()` 
- Updated to use proper closure syntax: `||` instead of passing value directly
- Fixed 3 locations in handlers.rs

### Files Modified
- âœ… `backend/src/handlers.rs` - Fixed extensions() calls
