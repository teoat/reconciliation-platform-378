## 📋 Remaining Work

### 3.1 Authentication Features - Implementation (Remaining)

#### 🔴 Priority 1: Password Reset (4-6 hours)

**What Exists**:
- ✅ Database table exists in migration
- ✅ Models defined
- ✅ Handlers partially exist but incomplete
- ✅ `EnhancedAuthService` has stub methods

**What Needs to be Implemented**:

1. **Complete `generate_password_reset_token` method**:
   ```rust
   // In backend/src/services/auth.rs
   // Current: Line 333-345 (stub)
}}
   ```

2. **Implement token storage in database**:
   - Store hashed token in `password_reset_tokens` table
   - Set expiration (30 minutes)
   - Store IP address and user agent
   - Invalidate old tokens for the user

3. **Complete `confirm_password_reset` method**:
   ```rust
   // In backend/src/services/auth.rs
   // Current: Line 348-361 (stub)
}} 
   ```

4. **Implement token validation**:
   - Look up token by hash
   - Check expiration
   - Check if already used
   - Update user password
   - Mark token as used

5. **Email sending integration**:
   - Add `lettre` dependency to Cargo.toml
   - Implement email service
   - Send password reset email with token
   - Note: Currently returns token in response (remove in production)

#### 🔴 Priority 2: Email Verification (3-4 hours)

**Database**: ✅ Exists  
**Models**: ✅ Complete

**To Implement**:
1. Generate email verification token on user registration
2. Send verification email
3. Add verification endpoint `/api/auth/verify-email`
4. Store token in database with expiration
5. Update user email_verified status
6. Add resend verification email endpoint

#### 🟡 Priority 3: Two-Factor Authentication (4-6 hours)

**Database**: ✅ Exists  
**Models**: ✅ Complete

**Dependencies Needed**:
```toml
# Add to Cargo.toml
totp = "2.0"  # or "otpauth" for TOTP generation
qrcode = "0.14"  # For QR code generation for authenticator apps
```

**To Implement**:
1. Generate TOTP secret
2. Store secret securely (hashed) in database
3. Generate backup codes
4. Endpoint to setup 2FA: `POST /api/auth/2fa/setup`
5. Endpoint to verify 2FA: `POST /api/auth/2fa/verify`
6. Endpoint to enable/disable 2FA
7. QR code generation for authenticator apps
8. Integration with login flow

#### 🟡 Priority 4: Session Management with Redis (3-4 hours)

**Database**: ✅ Exists  
**Models**: ✅ Complete

**To Implement**:
1. Add Redis client to existing cache service
2. Store sessions in Redis with TTL
3. Implement session cleanup job
4. Add concurrent session limits
5. Update `EnhancedAuthService::create_session` to store in Redis
6. Implement session timeout
7. Add endpoint to list/revoke sessions

#### 🟢 Priority 5: Refresh Tokens (2-3 hours)

**Database**: ✅ Exists (in user_sessions table)

**To Implement**:
1. Generate refresh token on login
2. Store in user_sessions table
3. Add refresh endpoint `/api/auth/refresh`
4. Implement token rotation
5. Add token blacklisting (for logout)
6. Update handlers to issue refresh tokens

---

### 3.2 Monitoring & Observability (Remaining - 3 hours)

**Note**: Much infrastructure already exists (verified by previous Agent 3 work)

#### To Implement:
1. **OpenTelemetry Integration**:
   - Add tracing to all handlers
   - Configure Jaeger integration
   - Add trace context propagation

2. **Business Metrics**:
   - Track reconciliation job metrics
   - Monitor file upload metrics
   - Track user activity metrics

3. **Log Aggregation**:
   - Configure structured logging (mostly done)
   - Set up log retention policies

---

### 3.3 Performance Optimizations (Remaining - 3 hours)

#### To Implement:
1. **Query Optimization**:
   - Add missing indexes (check migration)
   - Optimize slow queries identified
   - Add query result caching

2. **Redis Caching**:
   - Cache frequently accessed data
   - Implement cache invalidation strategy
   - Monitor cache hit rates

3. **API Optimization**:
   - Add response compression
   - Optimize pagination
   - Add response caching headers

---

### 3.4 Additional Features (Remaining - 2 hours)

#### To Implement:
1. **Audit Logging**: Infrastructure exists, needs comprehensive logging
2. **Export/Import**: Enhance data export capabilities
3. **Notifications**: Notification system implementation

## 📊 Summary

### Completed (✅)
- Database schema and models for all auth features
- All models compile successfully
- Foundation established for authentication enhancements

### In Progress (🔴)
- None (all work is partial)

### Remaining (⏳)
- Complete password reset implementation
- Implement email verification
- Implement 2FA with TOTP
- Session management with Redis
- Refresh token support
- Monitoring & observability enhancements
- Performance optimizations
- Additional features

---

## 🎯 Recommendations

### Immediate Next Steps:

1. **Complete Password Reset** (Highest Priority):
   - Implement database operations for token storage
   - Add proper token validation
   - Integrate with existing handlers
   - Estimated: 4-6 hours

2. **Add Required Dependencies**:
   ```toml
   # backend/Cargo.toml
   lettre = "0.11"          # Email sending
   totp = "2.0"             # TOTP for 2FA
   qrcode = "0.14"          # QR codes for 2FA
   ```

3. **Testing**:
   - Create integration tests for password reset flow
   - Test token expiration
   - Test token reuse prevention

### Architecture Notes:

- **Database migrations** already exist - no need to create new ones
- **Handlers** are partially implemented - need completion
- **Email sending** needs SMTP configuration in environment variables
- **Redis** is already configured - just needs integration

## 🎉 Conclusion

Agent 3 has successfully established the foundation for all authentication features by creating the necessary database models and schema definitions. All models compile successfully and are ready for implementation.

**Next Agent** should continue with implementing the complete password reset flow, followed by email verification, 2FA, and session management.

**Status**: ✅ Foundation Complete - Ready for Implementation
