## ✅ Completed Tasks

### Task 4: Health Check Endpoint Enhancements ✅
**Status**: COMPLETE  
**Time**: 30 minutes

**Changes Made**:
- ✅ Enhanced `/api/health` endpoint with database connectivity check
- ✅ Added Redis connectivity check to health endpoint
- ✅ Integrated database pool statistics reporting
- ✅ Enhanced `/api/ready` endpoint with comprehensive dependency checking
- ✅ Added proper HTTP status codes (200 for healthy, 503 for not ready, 202 for degraded)
- ✅ Added service-level status reporting

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/src/main.rs` (health check handlers)

**Details**:
- Health check now returns:
  - Database connection status
  - Redis connection status  
  - Database pool statistics (size, idle, active connections)
  - Individual service health status
  - Proper error messages when services are unavailable
  
- Readiness check returns:
  - Individual service readiness status
  - Proper HTTP codes for Kubernetes probes
  - Timestamp and uptime information
  
**Impact**:
- Production-ready monitoring
- Proper Kubernetes liveness/readiness probes
- Detailed dependency status for troubleshooting
- Graceful degradation support
