## 🚀 Immediate Next Actions

### Priority 1: Test Execution (30 min - 1 hour)

**Action**: Run comprehensive test suite

```bash
cd /Users/Arief/Desktop/378/backend

# Run all tests
cargo test

# Check for failures
cargo test -- --nocapture 2>&1 | grep -E "FAILED|panicked"

# Generate coverage report (if tarpaulin available)
cargo install cargo-tarpaulin
cargo tarpaulin --out html
```

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Tests compile
- ⚠️ Some may fail (expected)
- 📊 Coverage baseline established

---

### Priority 2: Quick Code Cleanup (15-30 min)

**Actions**:
1. Fix unused variable warnings
2. Remove redundant field names
3. Clean up unused imports

**Automated Fixes**:
```bash
# Apply clippy suggestions
cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty

# Or manually fix:
# - Prefix unused variables with `_`
# - Remove redundant field names in struct init
# - Remove unused imports
```

**Files to Clean**:
- `src/services/email.rs` - Unused imports
- `src/services/project.rs` - Redundant field names
- `src/handlers.rs` - Unused config variables

---

### Priority 3: Database Optimization (30-60 min)

**Actions**:
1. Review connection pooling configuration
2. Add missing database indexes
3. Enable query result caching
4. Test query performance

**Check**:
```bash
# Review database module
cat src/database/mod.rs

# Check for connection pool settings
grep -r "pool\|connection" src/database/
```

---

### Priority 4: Test Coverage Enhancement (2-4 hours)

**Actions**:
